SMART CANE:

➤ Canes can assist people with all levels of visual impairment from low to high. 

➤ Navigating with white cane presents significant challenges for individuals with visual impairments, particularly within complex environments.

➤ They face difficulties like uneven surfaces in the surroundings, if the cane breaks while the user is out and about, it could leave the person with no way of safely navigating home, they could face animals lying around where they might them, crossing the pedestrian during traffic, improper size of the stick can cause them pain.

 ➤ Thus, we are motivated to develop a smart white cane to overcome these difficulties where we use sensors to identify any obstacles beforehand not only vibrate or make sound to warn them
